In this article, we will provide a detailed recap of the stream, covering key points, updates, and future plans for the game.\nMonetization and Test Environment Before diving into the specifics of update 3.0, the developers addressed the issue of monetization in the test environment. Currently, the battle pass and bazaar monetization features are disabled on the test servers to prevent players from spending actual money on items. Although the developers expressed a desire to find a workaround, it seems that time constraints prevented them from doing so. Moving forward, they plan to enable monetization once the update is released.\nRelease Date and Testing Although there is no official release date for update 3.0, its availability on the test servers suggests that the update is coming soon. The developers emphasized the importance of test live for bug testing and stated that the release date will likely be determined once certification is complete for consoles. This ensures a uniform rollout across all platforms.\nBattle Pass Progression During the Q\u0026A, the developers clarified that players can progress in the battle pass on private, modded servers, single-player, and co-op modes. The battle pass is formulated differently for a survival game, unlike games such as Call of Duty or Fortnite, where performance in individual matches determines progress. The battle pass aims to respect players’ time by eliminating the need for constant grinding and offering a reasonable completion timeframe.\nFuture Battle Passes and Themes Future battle passes in Conan Exiles will explore different themes and introduce new story-related content. Not all chapters will revolve around sorcery, as each new age will bring fresh themes to the game. An age is an overarching season, comprising two or three chapters, each lasting approximately three months. This content drop structure is similar to that of Rainbow Six Siege.\nRewards and Challenges While discussing the battle pass, the developers briefly mentioned the placement of rewards, emphasizing that these placements are final. Additionally, reaching level 57 in the first battle pass grants players a full refund of chrome coins to purchase the next one. The developers also emphasized the significance of challenges and their impact on player progression. They will be collecting data on challenges and adjusting experience gain to ensure a balanced progression system.\nCross-Platform and Cross-Progression Currently, there are no plans for cross-platform or cross-progression functionality in Conan Exiles. Although the idea of cross-play has been considered, it is not a high priority for the development team at the moment. However, the developers are actively exploring the notion of allowing players to transmog heavy armor over light armor and simplifying the crafting process for weapons.\nMonetization and Storefront To address concerns about monetization, the developers assured players that all items obtained through the battle pass and bazaar are account-bound and accessible across any character, both past and future. The only exception to this rule is the spell flasks, which can only be claimed and used once. The developers also expressed a commitment to not sell single-use items for money, ensuring that all purchases offer permanent benefits to players.\nServer Wipes and XP Caps There are no server wipes planned for update 3.0, providing continuity for players as they progress in the game. In terms of experience gain, there is no top-end cap on how much XP players can accumulate within a set period of time. XP multipliers cap at 20, with players earning 5 per day. Consequently, players have the potential to complete a staggering 100 challenges in a single day, maximizing their XP gains.\nAge of Sorcery as a Free Update In response to a common query, the developers reiterated that Age of Sorcery is a free update. They explained that the battle pass and bazaar systems generate revenue to fund future updates, ensuring that the game remains accessible to all players. The developers also clarified that any criticisms of Funcom being greedy are unfounded, as the revenue generated from the game’s monetization features goes directly into development and improving the game.\nFuture Plans for Sociable Gameplay Finally, the developers discussed plans to make gameplay more sociable in the future. This includes restoring the visibility of the player list and implementing proximity voice chat. These changes aim to enhance the social aspect of the game, allowing players to interact more seamlessly with one another.\nConclusion In this Q\u0026A livestream recap, we’ve covered the main points discussed by the Conan Exiles development team regarding the highly-anticipated update 3.0 and the Age of Sorcery expansion. From monetization and battle pass progression to cross-platform functionality and future plans, players can expect a range of exciting updates and improvements in the coming months. Stay tuned for more news and updates as the development team continues to refine and expand Conan Exiles.\n","wordCount":"819","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-29T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-29T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Elizabeth Graves"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gameinstants.github.io/posts/conan-exiles-cross-platform-ps4-pc/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Game Instants","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gameinstants.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Game Instants (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gameinstants.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Game Instants</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Update 3.0 Dev Q&A Recap - Everything You Need to Know About Conan Exiles</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-06-29 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 29, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;819 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Elizabeth Graves</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#monetization-and-test-environment>Monetization and Test Environment</a></li><li><a href=#release-date-and-testing>Release Date and Testing</a></li><li><a href=#battle-pass-progression>Battle Pass Progression</a></li><li><a href=#future-battle-passes-and-themes>Future Battle Passes and Themes</a></li><li><a href=#rewards-and-challenges>Rewards and Challenges</a></li><li><a href=#cross-platform-and-cross-progression>Cross-Platform and Cross-Progression</a></li><li><a href=#monetization-and-storefront>Monetization and Storefront</a></li><li><a href=#server-wipes-and-xp-caps>Server Wipes and XP Caps</a></li><li><a href=#age-of-sorcery-as-a-free-update>Age of Sorcery as a Free Update</a></li><li><a href=#future-plans-for-sociable-gameplay>Future Plans for Sociable Gameplay</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Po_L6WGrTDA style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>In a recent Q&A livestream, the Conan Exiles developers discussed the highly-anticipated update 3.0, addressing some of the most pressing questions about the upcoming Age of Sorcery expansion.
