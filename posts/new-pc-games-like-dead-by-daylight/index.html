Developed by Dog Howl Games, this game combines intense PvP gameplay with elements of teamwork and strategic thinking. In a recent hands-off preview, I had the opportunity to witness the thrilling gameplay and get a taste of what Level Zero has to offer.\nThe Storyline and Gameplay Level Zero takes players on a science expedition gone wrong, where four scientists find themselves pitted against two powerful monsters. The objective of the game is simple yet challenging: as the scientists, your goal is to restart the electrical system by finding and fixing the broken fuse box in all three sectors. Failure to restore power within 30 minutes results in defeat.\nOnce the power is restored, the gameplay intensifies as the scientists must confront the monsters in a tense final confrontation. This encounter plunges the players into total darkness for 60 seconds, and only one scientist needs to survive to secure victory. However, should even a single scientist perish, the game is lost.\nTeamwork and Strategy Teamwork is crucial in Level Zero, as players must effectively communicate and work together to survive. The game emphasizes strategic thinking and resource management, as players have limited resources available to them. Rather than relying on guns or melee weapons, the scientists must utilize light as their ultimate weapon against the monsters.\nThe scientists have various light sources at their disposal, each with its own advantages and limitations. They can choose to use the UV light, which does not run out of power but does not harm the monsters. Alternatively, they can opt for the torch, which inflicts some damage but gradually depletes. The flare is another option, as it both illuminates the surroundings and inflicts significant damage to the monsters.\nIn the event that a scientist is ambushed and killed, fellow teammates have the ability to revive them. However, death does not mean the end of the game for the deceased scientist. Instead, they control a weaponless drone, which allows them to assist their teammates by marking objects, taking items to them, and tracking monsters using a UV light.\nThe Monsters’ Role Playing as the monsters in Level Zero is a vastly different experience. The monsters’ objective is to eliminate each scientist or prevent them from activating the mainframe. Unlike the scientists, monsters possess innate abilities such as sensing human heartbeats, manipulating electricity to disable light sources, and using an ear-piercing scream to force humans to drop objects. They can also crawl through vents, adding an extra layer of fear and unpredictability.\nTo regain energy, monsters must collect eggs at the beginning of the game. Once their energy is maxed out, it automatically regenerates over time. Although monsters can see in the dark, they do not have a mini-map. This presents a trade-off for players, as they must decide when to utilize their powerful abilities. When killed, monsters respawn after a lengthy 35-second wait.\nImpressive Gameplay and Map Design Even though I did not have the opportunity for hands-on gameplay, the footage showcased impressive gameplay mechanics. From strategically clearing rooms and searching for a toolbox to trapping scientists in a pincher formation, Level Zero emphasizes strategy and teamwork. The communication between teammates is essential as they navigate the eerie sectors. The inclusion of dynamic events, such as bursting pipes, and random blackouts adds tension and keeps players on their toes.\nAt launch, Level Zero will feature three maps, with the preview primarily focusing on the space station. While the design may not be wildly original, it is well-executed. The anticipation of random blackouts for 40 seconds heightens the fear factor, as monsters gain free rein during these moments. The combination of thrilling gameplay and immersive environments creates an experience that is sure to terrify players.\nProgression and Customization As players achieve their goals in Level Zero, they are rewarded with experience points. These points can be used to purchase up to three perks, offering various advantages such as increased running speed. However, these perks are lost upon death, although they can be reclaimed later on. Additionally, the game offers character customization options, including different cosmetic items such as skins, gloves, and costumes. While limited information was provided about these customization options, Dog Howl Games has expressed plans to introduce more maps, game modes, and cosmetics in the future.\nConclusion Level Zero stands out as a promising asymmetrical survival horror game that combines the best elements of Dead by Daylight and Alien Isolation. With its intense gameplay, emphasis on teamwork and strategy, and terrifying atmosphere, Level Zero offers a unique experience for horror game enthusiasts. The level of detail and commitment to ongoing post-launch content support from Dog Howl Games further adds to the excitement surrounding the game’s release. Prepare to face your fears when Level Zero launches next year on PC and consoles.\nFor more information on the latest horror games, be sure to check out our first preview of the Outlast Trials and our hands-on experience with the Callisto Protocol.
