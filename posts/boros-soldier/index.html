Today, we will be diving into the world of Magic: The Gathering, specifically exploring the Boros Soldiers deck archetype. This powerful red and white deck has been flying under the radar, but trust me when I say that it is truly amazing. In this article, we will be analyzing the decklist, discussing strategies and synergies, and showcasing its performance in high-level gameplay. By the end of this article, you will understand why Boros Soldiers is a force to be reckoned with.\nDecklist Breakdown The foundation of the Boros Soldiers deck lies in its mono White core, supported by key cards such as the Fable of the Mirror Breaker. This 2/2 Goblin not only creates Treasures when it attacks, but also allows you to discard two cards and draw two cards. This card alone provides immense value, allowing you to dig deeper into your deck while generating resources.\nHowever, the deck isn’t solely focused on mono White soldiers. One notable inclusion is the Barrin, Tolarian Recruiter, a 2-mana Human Soldier that creates a 1/1 white Soldier creature token at the beginning of your end step if you control a creature with power greater than its base power. This card offers a consistent source of Soldier tokens, even without the requirement to attack. It synergizes well with other cards in the deck, such as the Valiant Veteran and the Siege Veteran.\nThe Valiant Veteran is a key piece in the Boros Soldiers puzzle. It provides a +1/+1 bonus to all other soldiers on the battlefield. With the ability to boost the entire team, the Valiant Veteran turns even the smallest soldiers into formidable threats. Speaking of threats, the Siege Veteran also plays a vital role in the deck. At the beginning of combat on your turn, it puts a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control. This ability allows you to grow your army and increase their power, giving you an edge over your opponents.\nKiller Combos and Synergies The Boros Soldiers deck is not just about brute force; it also has a variety of tricks up its sleeve. One notable combo is the interaction between the Angel Fire Ignition and the Valiant Veteran. Angel Fire Ignition not only grants +2/+2 to a target creature, but also grants vigilance, trample, lifelink, and indestructible until the end of turn. This can turn an already powerful soldier into an unstoppable force, allowing it to attack without fear of retaliation.\nAdditionally, the deck includes powerful removal options. The Obliterating Bolt, a sorcery spell, deals 4 damage to a target creature or planeswalker. If the targeted permanent would die this turn, it gets exiled instead. This versatile removal option can take care of threats both big and small, allowing you to maintain control of the battlefield. On the other hand, Destroying Evil, an instant spell, destroys target creature with toughness 4 or greater. Its instant speed gives you the flexibility to respond to threats at the most opportune moments.\nGameplay and Performance With a win rate of approximately 80%, Boros Soldiers has proven its worth in Mythic rank gameplay. The combination of powerful creatures, removal options, and synergistic abilities allows the deck to consistently dominate the competition. Whether you’re facing other Soldier decks or aggressive mono red decks, the Boros Soldiers archetype has the tools to secure victory.\nOne remarkable card in the deck is Muriel, Shield of Argive. Not only does she prevent your opponents from casting spells or activating abilities on their turn, but she also creates an army of Soldier tokens whenever she attacks. With Burden fetching soldiers every turn, it’s not uncommon to amass an army of 10 or more tokens with Muriel. This overwhelming force can quickly dismantle your opponents’ defenses and secure victory.\nFinal Thoughts and Closing In conclusion, Boros Soldiers is an incredibly potent deck archetype that deserves more recognition. Its versatility, powerful creatures, and removal options make it a force to be reckoned with. If you’re looking for a deck that is easy to play yet still provides immense strategic depth, Boros Soldiers is the perfect choice. So, grab your cards and join the Boros Soldiers in their quest for victory!\nThank you for taking the time to read this article.
