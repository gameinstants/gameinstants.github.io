Well, we have some exciting news for you! In a recent live broadcast by Funcom, they discussed the implementation of cross-platform play for Conan Exiles. This means that players on PC, PS4, and Xbox can now join forces and play together on shared servers. In this article, we will dive into the details of this long-awaited feature and explore what it means for the Conan Exiles community.\nThe Power of Cross Platform Play For those unfamiliar with cross platform play, it allows gamers on different platforms to come together and enjoy a game in unison. In the case of Conan Exiles, PC players can finally team up with their PS4 and Xbox counterparts. This is a huge milestone for the gaming industry as cross platform play is often limited to only a handful of games. Now, Conan Exiles joins the ranks of the few titles that support this amazing feature.\nBreaking Down the News During the live broadcast, Funcom unveiled their plans for Conan Exiles, and they did not disappoint. Besides implementing cross platform play, they are also working on other exciting features that will enhance the overall gaming experience for players.\n1. Character Customization One aspect that players have been longing for is the ability to change their character’s appearance even after starting the game. Currently, players must settle for their initial character design, including their hairstyle, skin color, and overall proportions. However, Funcom is actively working on introducing a feature that allows players to modify their character’s appearance at any point in the game. This is especially welcome news for those who want to freshen up their characters’ style and make them truly their own.\n2. Expanded Storyline Another key area that Funcom aims to improve upon is the game’s storyline. Many players have expressed their dissatisfaction with the abrupt ending of the game. After removing the bracelets, the character walks into the desert, and the game suddenly concludes. Funcom acknowledges this flaw and is committed to giving the story more depth and substance. This revamp will ensure that players have a more satisfying and complete gaming experience when reaching the game’s end.\n3. Mounts for Easier Travel The community has been eagerly awaiting the introduction of mounts in Conan Exiles to facilitate faster and more convenient travel within the vast map. Funcom has confirmed that horses will be the first type of mount to be added to the game. However, they have not ruled out the possibility of implementing additional mount types in the future. So, while you may be galloping through the desert on your trusty steed for now, who knows what exotic creatures may become rideable companions in the days to come.\n4. Alternative Lighting Methods Dealing with darkness in the game’s environment has always presented a challenge. Currently, players rely on torches to navigate through dark areas. However, Funcom is working on introducing alternative lighting methods that don’t solely rely on torches. While the specifics of these new methods have yet to be revealed, players can look forward to a more diverse range of options for illuminating their surroundings, whether through the use of magic or other means.\nThe Future of Conan Exiles The addition of cross platform play to Conan Exiles is a game-changer for both enthusiasts and skeptics of this feature. It opens up a world of possibilities for players to connect, interact, and forge alliances with a broader community. Funcom’s commitment to improving character customization, expanding the storyline, introducing mounts, and enhancing lighting options demonstrates their dedication to delivering a rich and immersive gaming experience.\nIn conclusion, the Conan Exiles community has been eagerly awaiting the arrival of cross platform play, and now that it’s here, players can finally enjoy the game alongside their friends on different platforms. Funcom’s plans for ongoing improvements and feature additions promise an even brighter future for Conan Exiles. So, saddle up, customize your characters, and prepare for new adventures in the vast and treacherous world of Conan Exiles. Support this fantastic development by sharing the news and joining the ever-growing community of players. Together, let’s conquer the Exiled Lands!\nNote: If you wish to see more content like this or have any suggestions for future videos or game news coverage, please don’t hesitate to comment below and let us know.
