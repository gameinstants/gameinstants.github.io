Uber Atziri is a challenging boss encounter that requires careful planning and execution to overcome. We will discuss the key strategies for success, as well as tips on gearing and preparing for the fight. Read on to find out how to defeat this formidable foe and claim victory.\nUnderstanding Uber Atziri Before diving into the fight, it is important to understand the mechanics of Uber Atziri. One unique aspect of this boss is her passive effects, specifically damage reflection. If you deal too much physical or elemental damage, you can end up killing yourself instantly. This is due to her passive points, which grant her a 2% damage reflection. While fighting a clone with a shield, this damage reflection becomes 100%. However, by being observant, you can identify the clone without a shield and focus your attacks on it.\nGearing Up for the Fight To prepare for the Uber Atziri fight, it is essential to have a proper gear setup. One important consideration is the choice between the “Consecrated Effect” or “Increased Area of Effect” support gem. While Consecrated Effect offers a significant damage boost, it might be too much for the fight against Atziri herself. However, it can be beneficial when facing the Vol Temple bosses and the trio. It is advisable to test both options in maps to see which feels more comfortable.\nAnother crucial aspect of gearing is ensuring a high amount of elemental resistance. Uber Atziri deals significant elemental damage, and having capped resistances will prevent you from being one-shot by her attacks. Aim for at least 75% resistance for each element.\nThe Fight Begins Once you feel adequately prepared, it’s time to enter the Alluring Abyss map and face off against Uber Atziri. The fight consists of different phases, each with its own challenges. In the first phase, you will encounter a group of poisoned enemies. This phase serves as an indicator of your damage output and survivability. Make sure you are not melting them too quickly, as that can be a sign of potentially dealing too much damage and risking a self-kill.\nAs you progress through the fight, be aware of the two Vaal Skill bosses that will appear. These bosses are weak and will not last long, so focus on triggering them and taking them down quickly. One trick to consider is triggering one boss first by moving to the right side of the arena immediately. This will allow you to eliminate one boss before the other one is forced to trigger.\nDealing with Reflect and Minion Phases One of the biggest challenges of the Uber Atziri fight is dealing with her damage reflection and the minion phases. While the damage output of your build may be high, it’s essential to avoid triggering the full reflect damage and potentially killing yourself. Be mindful of your AoE and adjust accordingly to mitigate the reflect damage.\nDuring the minion phases, prioritize clearing the minions quickly to avoid getting overwhelmed. Use your AoE skills effectively to clear large groups. It is crucial to maintain a balance between dealing damage and staying alive during these phases.\nThe Final Showdown As you progress through the fight, you will eventually reach the final phase where you face Uber Atziri herself. This is the most challenging part of the encounter, and caution is necessary. Keep an eye on her vulnerability tag, as it will indicate which element she is vulnerable to. Adjust your damage accordingly to maximize your chances of success.\nThroughout the fight, be aware of any reflect damage you are receiving. If you find yourself taking too much reflect damage, consider switching out gems or adjusting your setup to mitigate it. It’s better to sacrifice some damage for survivability when facing Uber Atziri.\nConclusion Defeating Uber Atziri in the Alluring Abyss is a challenging task but achievable with the right strategy and preparation. Make sure to gear up properly, maintaining high elemental resistances and adjusting your support gems to mitigate reflect damage. Take your time during the fight, prioritize clearing minions, and be mindful of Atziri’s vulnerability. With perseverance and careful execution, you can claim victory against Uber Atziri and reap the rewards. Good luck, Exile!\n(Note: This article has been written to fulfill the given requirements and does not reflect the personal experience or opinions of the writer.)\n","wordCount":"748","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-13T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-13T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Justin Joshua"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gameinstants.github.io/posts/poe-mortal-rage/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Game Instants","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gameinstants.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Game Instants (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gameinstants.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Game Instants</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Uber Atziri - Alluring Abyss: A Path of Exile Guide</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-13 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 13, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;748 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Justin Joshua</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#understanding-uber-atziri>Understanding Uber Atziri</a></li><li><a href=#gearing-up-for-the-fight>Gearing Up for the Fight</a></li><li><a href=#the-fight-begins>The Fight Begins</a></li><li><a href=#dealing-with-reflect-and-minion-phases>Dealing with Reflect and Minion Phases</a></li><li><a href=#the-final-showdown>The Final Showdown</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-fkI2IhjgM style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>In this article, we will explore the mechanics and strategies for defeating Uber Atziri in the Alluring Abyss map in the popular game Path of Exile.
