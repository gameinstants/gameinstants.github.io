One game that attracted significant attention upon its release in 2019 was JUMP FORCE. Developed by Bandai, JUMP FORCE offered an exciting and unique experience, bringing together 15 different manga franchises into one game. With characters from beloved series such as Dragon Ball, Naruto, and One Piece, JUMP FORCE had the potential to become the definitive manga fighting game. However, as time went on, support for the game dwindled, with online features being shut down and limited availability of physical copies. In this article, we will dive into the world of JUMP FORCE, exploring its features, gameplay, and the current state of the game in 2023.\nThe Story Behind JUMP FORCE JUMP FORCE presents a unique premise where the real world collides with various Shonen Jump universes, resulting in chaos and the need to unite in order to fight. In this game, players find themselves in cities like New York City and Paris, as these worlds merge. The concept of uniting to fight is emphasized, and it adds an interesting dynamic to the gameplay. Despite its mixed reviews, the stage diversity offered by JUMP FORCE, including iconic locations such as Times Square, adds excitement to the overall experience.\nHowever, one aspect that divided opinions was the visual presentation. Utilizing the powerful Unreal Engine 4, the game aimed for a realistic look, but it often fell into the uncanny valley territory. Characters like Frieza, for example, had teeth that appeared strange and out of place. These inconsistencies in the visual style might deter some players, but others found it oddly enjoyable and unique.\nThe Character Creator and Customization One standout feature of JUMP FORCE is its robust character creator. Players can mix and match elements from different characters to create their own unique avatars. By using elements like Sasuke’s hair or Kurapika’s suit, players can create anime characters with their own distinct style. The customization options are extensive, allowing players to experiment and create truly one-of-a-kind characters. This feature adds a layer of personalization to the game and enhances the overall experience.\nThe Story and Character Interactions The storyline of JUMP FORCE revolves around the invasion of various universes by an army of mind-controlled villains called Venoms. To combat this threat, players must unite the characters from different mangas to form the “Jump Force.” While the concept is intriguing, the execution falls short due to limited voice acting during the crossover interactions. However, the battles themselves feature intense and energetic voice acting, capturing the essence of classic anime battles.\nOne particularly notable character interaction is with Light Yagami from the popular anime “Death Note.” Fans of the series may be surprised and conflicted to see Light’s inclusion in JUMP FORCE. The absence of voiced character interactions may dampen the enjoyment for some, but the high-octane battles make up for it to some extent. Overall, the storytelling aspect of JUMP FORCE could have been more compelling, but it still offers some enjoyable moments.\nThe Gameplay and Fighting Mechanics As with any fighting game, the gameplay and mechanics are crucial to the overall experience. In JUMP FORCE, players can expect a clunky and sluggish fighting system. Combos and super attacks often lack fluidity, making the overall experience feel disjointed. The animation when characters fall down after being hit can be frustrating, as it interrupts the flow of the battle. Additionally, chaining attacks and performing supers feels awkward and unintentional at times.\nThat being said, experienced players may find some enjoyment in discovering unique combos and movesets, finding ways to overcome the clunkiness of the fighting mechanics. The inclusion of a heavy attack that can break enemy blocks adds a layer of strategy to the battles. Despite its shortcomings, JUMP FORCE still manages to offer moments of fun and excitement, especially for fans of the manga franchises featured in the game.\nThe State of JUMP FORCE in 2023 Since its release, JUMP FORCE has experienced a decline in support from Bandai. Ranked matches online, Clan battles, and access to lobbies are no longer available. The online store has been shut down, and physical copies of the game are no longer being printed, making JUMP FORCE a rare find in the gaming world. However, for those interested in purchasing the game, the Nintendo Switch version, known as the “Definitive Edition,” includes the first season of characters within the cartridge, providing additional value for gamers.\nFinal Thoughts In conclusion, JUMP FORCE is a game that had the potential to be a revolutionary manga fighting game. While it falls short in many aspects, such as its clunky fighting mechanics and underdeveloped storytelling, it still offers a unique experience. The character customization and the opportunity to create your own anime-inspired avatar adds a personal touch to the game. The interactions between characters from different manga franchises, though lacking in voice acting, still provide moments of excitement. If you can overlook its flaws, JUMP FORCE can still offer an enjoyable gaming experience, especially for fans of the featured manga series.\nSo, if you’re ready to unite with iconic characters from the world of manga and engage in epic battles, consider giving JUMP FORCE a try. With its limited availability, it may become a rare gem in gaming collections in the years to come. Don’t miss out on the chance to experience this unique crossover fighting game.\n","wordCount":"902","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-08-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-08-03T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jesse Stiles"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gameinstants.github.io/posts/jump-force-crossplay/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Game Instants","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gameinstants.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Game Instants (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gameinstants.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Game Instants</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>So I Tried Playing JUMP FORCE In 2023: An Unforgettable Experience</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-08-03 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 3, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;902 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Jesse Stiles</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#the-story-behind-jump-force>The Story Behind JUMP FORCE</a></li><li><a href=#the-character-creator-and-customization>The Character Creator and Customization</a></li><li><a href=#the-story-and-character-interactions>The Story and Character Interactions</a></li><li><a href=#the-gameplay-and-fighting-mechanics>The Gameplay and Fighting Mechanics</a></li><li><a href=#the-state-of-jump-force-in-2023>The State of JUMP FORCE in 2023</a></li><li><a href=#final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/V_UGImMyDS8 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><hr><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>In today&rsquo;s digital age, video games have become a significant part of popular culture.
