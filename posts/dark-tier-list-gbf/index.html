In this article, we will focus on the Dark element, which is widely considered one of the most versatile and affordable elements to build in the game. We will explore the key units and skills that make Dark a preferred choice for many players, as well as its strengths and weaknesses. Whether you’re a new player or a seasoned veteran, this guide will provide valuable insights on maximizing your Dark element team.\nBefore we dive into the details, it’s important to note that this guide is not a step-by-step tutorial on building a Dark element team. Instead, it aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the element and its potential, allowing players to make informed decisions based on their own gameplay style and goals.\nDark Element: Versatility and Affordability Dark is known for its versatility and affordability compared to other top-tier elements in Granblue Fantasy. It offers a wide range of strategies and gameplay options, making it suitable for various events and raids. One of the reasons for its versatility is the presence of key units like Bowman, who is a staple in most Dark element setups. Bowman’s skills, such as Counterclaw and Doubtless Pact Members, make him a valuable addition to any team. Counterclaw activates after an enemy’s special attack, making it particularly effective against event bosses. This skill, combined with other Dark element units, enables players to achieve one-turn One-Game (OG) bursts in many scenarios.\nMoreover, building a Dark element team is relatively inexpensive compared to other elements. The core composition of a Dark team generally includes three units: Bowman, replacing another unit in non-hard raids, and two core units that can be obtained easily. Silver Star Axes can be used as budget options, making the entry cost for Dark element teams more accessible.\nFire Element: High Difficulty and Limited Usage On the other hand, the Fire element in Granblue Fantasy is considered one of the most challenging elements to work with. It requires a significant investment and offers limited options for hard content. While Fire can be viable for specific setups like Flight Racing, it lacks the versatility and universal units that Dark possesses. The core unit for Fire is Ground Percival, and other viable combinations include units like Mid-Summer Meme for burst setups. However, Fire element teams are generally less effective in various scenarios compared to other elements. One off-element use for Fire is the 1.7 BHL (Bouncer Healer Lumberjack) setup, which can be explored for players interested in this element.\nEarth Element: Mediocre Performance The Earth element in Granblue Fantasy falls in the middle when it comes to performance. It is considered an “okay” element with no exceptional strengths or weaknesses. While Earth teams can be effective in certain races like Unite and Fight (UBN) and sub-Hard Lucilius (HL), they lack the speed and efficiency of elements like Wind. Earth teams often rely on combining random units rather than having a set core composition. This flexibility can be advantageous in terms of team-building but may result in inconsistency. Earth element teams require a medium to high investment for moderate returns.\nWater Element: Well-Rounded and Cost-Effective Water is generally regarded as a solid element in Granblue Fantasy. It offers a well-rounded experience with a variety of viable setups and strategies. Water teams have many alternatives and workarounds, making it a versatile choice for players. The element has impressive internals and can handle different scenarios effectively. Water teams can excel in BHL 1.5 setups and perform well in sub-HL content. One of the advantages of Water is that it doesn’t heavily rely on seasonal units, except for certain setups like the brush setup with Summer Lucio. Building a Water team, particularly with Varuna as a primal summon, is considered relatively cost-effective compared to other elements.\nWind Element: Strength and Dominance Wind is widely regarded as one of the best elements in Granblue Fantasy. It excels in various aspects, including fast farming, hard content setups, and sub-HL battles. Wind teams benefit from having neon as a free unit, which adds a significant advantage to the element. The Holy Trinity of Wind, consisting of dark, is considered a nearly universal composition for hard raids and burst setups. While Wind teams require seasonal swords for certain strategies, there are many options available to create a powerful team. Wind players have access to a wide range of units and setups that can be tailored to their preferred playstyle.\nLight Element: Massive Potential, Costly Requirements Light is an element with immense potential, particularly in hard content and raids. It offers the ability to farm all bar rates and boasts incredible burst capabilities. Light teams heavily rely on having both Grand Florian and Mugen, which are seasonal units. While Light element setups can be expensive due to the grid requirements, they can achieve impressive damage output. Light teams are most effective when utilizing sword grids with the inclusion of other key units. Despite the high investment needed, Light element teams have proven their worth in terms of performance.\nConclusion In conclusion, building a Dark element team in Granblue Fantasy offers versatility, affordability, and the potential for high damage output. Dark teams can excel in various scenarios, thanks to the presence of key units like Bowman and their unique skill sets. On the other hand, elements like Fire and Earth have their own strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for specific playstyles and strategies. Water and Wind elements provide a well-rounded experience with different viable setups. Lastly, Light element teams offer massive potential but require substantial investment.\nUnderstanding the unique characteristics and strengths of each element is crucial for players to make informed decisions and optimize their gameplay experience. By considering the information provided in this guide, players can build successful teams and conquer the challenges in Granblue Fantasy.\n","wordCount":"981","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-25T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-25T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrea Peters"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gameinstants.github.io/posts/dark-tier-list-gbf/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Game Instants","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gameinstants.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Game Instants (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gameinstants.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Game Instants</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gameinstants.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>The Ultimate Guide to Dark Tier List in Granblue Fantasy</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-06-25 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 25, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;981 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Andrea Peters</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#dark-element-versatility-and-affordability>Dark Element: Versatility and Affordability</a></li><li><a href=#fire-element-high-difficulty-and-limited-usage>Fire Element: High Difficulty and Limited Usage</a></li><li><a href=#earth-element-mediocre-performance>Earth Element: Mediocre Performance</a></li><li><a href=#water-element-well-rounded-and-cost-effective>Water Element: Well-Rounded and Cost-Effective</a></li><li><a href=#wind-element-strength-and-dominance>Wind Element: Strength and Dominance</a></li><li><a href=#light-element-massive-potential-costly-requirements>Light Element: Massive Potential, Costly Requirements</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CUBvflMJTBw style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Granblue Fantasy is a popular mobile game that offers various elements for players to choose from.
